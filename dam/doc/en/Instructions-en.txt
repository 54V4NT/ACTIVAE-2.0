Minimum performance requirements
===============================

Machine with a minimal install of Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit [1],
1GB of RAM, 8GB of available storage. At the minimum installation (covered in this document),
This machine will be used for all services: ACTIVAE 2.0, transcoding queue
and search API.

1: http://ubuntu.grn.cat/ubuntu-releases/lucid/ubuntu-10.04-server-i386.iso

After installing the base system, the following packages must also be installed.

# apt-get install gcc g++ subversion patch wget libxml2-dev mysql-server rrdtool libmysqlclient-dev libjpeg62-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf unzip python-pycurl pkg-config gettext

IMPORTANT:       ACTIVAE 2.0 is extremely flexible and scalable. Its performance is optimal when all
                  It is deploying services running on different machines, in high
                  availability and load balancing. This document specifies simple installation,
                  configuration and implementation of the platform on just one
                  server. For more complex configurations, consult the administrator's manual
                  in the /doc folder.

List of ports: explanation
===============================

Activate deploys services in various ports. They are specified below:

Port	     Descripción
------------------------------------------------------------------------
80	       Frontend: main balancer for all the different web servers.
9091	     Web: port through which the main interface is accesible, throughout the machine running ACTIVAE 2.0 server. These are the ports and machines balanced by the Frontend.
8000	     CTK: Port used by the platform for asynchronous data transmission.
8001	     Balancer for the transcoding queue, which is a XMLRPC service. The IP and port of the service is set by the constant QUEUE_SERVER and QUEUE_PORT.
8002	     Port on which each machine exports the search API using XMLRPC. The constant is LOOKUP_PORT.
8003	     Port on which each machine exports its transcoding queue via XMLRPC. The constant is PORT.
33060	     DBSlayer: Asynchronous MySQL balancing. The parameter is DB_HOST.


Therefore, to successfully execute the platform must
have access to these ports. Parameters can be amended
in config.py, in which case it will be necessary to reconfigure the
relevant balancers by editing these files:

  frontend/cherokee.conf.orig
  src/queue/cherokee.conf
  dabase/cherokee.conf


Architecture once deployed the platform
=============================================

                  -->  Back-end 1  -----
                 |     [Port 9091]      |
                 |                      |                    -> MySQL 1
Front-end -------|-->  Back-end 2  -----|-->   DBSlayer  ---|
[Port 80]        |     [Server2: 9091]  |    [Port 33060]    -> MySQL 2
                 |                      |
                  -->  Back-end 3  -----
                       [Server3: 9091]


                  -->  Transcode-engine 1
                 |     [Port 8003]
                 |

                 |
                  -->  Transcode-engine 3
                       [Port 8003]

Basic installation
==================

1) create user and group 'activae'

# useradd activae

2) Unzip or download the source.

In our example, we installed everything in opt/activae-inst (either
if the code is cloned directly from the github repo, or

# cd /opt
# git clone https://github.com/54V4NT/ACTIVAE-2.0.git
# git checkout dam-stable-branch

unzipping the package & copying files there from GitHub (https://github.com/54V4NT/ACTIVAE-2.0/tarball/master):

# cd /opt
# tar xzfv /directory/that/contains/activae.tar.gz

if performed by decompressing the source of a package that has been previously downloaded.

Then all the necessary files to install are stored in /opt/activae-inst.

3) Configure routes (not recommended).

You may configure the installation route/directory by altering
/opt/activae-inst/deployment/config.py

Optionally you can customize other routes
/opt/activae-inst/src/config.py
, but it's not necessary.

The installer automatically detects and downloads the dependencies
not in your downloaded package.

The default installer uses the specified routes in
activae-inst/deployment/config.py, so if you want to specify the
destination files simply edit this file. By default
downloads will be held in /opt/activae_src, and the installation in
/opt/activae.

4) Begin installation

To launch the installer, simply run the following:

# cd /opt/activae-inst/deployment
# sudo make install

The installer will ask to create the necessary directories and files,
with all necessary permissions, if needed.

Database
=============
The database creation and assignment of permissions would
take place like so:

# mysql -uroot -hlocalhost -p
[...]
mysql>	CREATE DATABASE activae;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON activae.* TO activae@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'activae';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON activae.* TO activae@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'activae';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	quit;

# cd /opt/activae-inst/database
# mysql -uroot -hlocalhost -p activae < activae.sql

Both commands will request the root user password for the MySQL server. Go to the MySQL manual for more information.

This completes installation of the platform.

Autostart settings and configuration
=====================================

First copy the startup scripts accompanying the platform,
in a suitable place:

# sudo cp /opt/activae/init.d/* /etc/init.d

Then configure the scripts for each run level.
For the default values use:

# sudo update-rc.d activae defaults

Executing the platform
==========================

Given that, as specified at the beginning of this document
We are talking about a basic installation on a single server,
to run the application you will simply have to type:

$ sudo /etc/init.d/activae start

And this spins up the ACTIVAE 2.0 services automatically:

- Web Balancer.
- Database Balancer.
- Transcoders.
- Export API.

Additionally, the system is ready to automatically spin these services back up
during eventual OS restarts.

NOTA: ACTIVAE 2.0 spins up it's own web server on port 80. This means
       if there is already another Web server using that port (eg Apache),
       the application will fail to start.

To access ACTIVAE 2.0
================

http://localhost

Default User: admin
Default password: admin
