It's scalable, open source, written in Python, designed to run on Ubuntu Server, and remarkably powerful in its ability to process multiple versions of media.  \r\nACTIVAE 2.0 supports live format transcoding, workflow, multiple users with different roles and ALCs; It uses standard metadata. Also, it can be use as a video hosting platform to playback online videos, sounds and images.  \r\nIt was originally developed by CENATIC, the Spanish National Open Source Center. The project was discontinued by CENATIC, but [a really nice guy](https://github.com/manolodd) recovered the source code to give it a second opportunity.   \r\nIt is now being translated to English so it' finally ready for prime time.\r\n\r\n##Why even bother with media management, isn't it free with cloud storage?\r\n\r\n**Actually no.** As more organizations, commercial & non-profit alike, generate more media, it becomes part of their value chain, their know-how and production processes. Yet it seems that over time the major commercial cloud storage services [Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.] have become _less_ capable of cataloging and retrieving complex, essential metadata.  \r\n\r\nWe think that _intelligent_ media management requires that the system see data not just as a single media file (audio, video, or image) with fixed metadata, but as the combination of that file, its metadata, and all necessary sidecar data [i.e.; closed captioning files, album art, etc]- plus the ability to edit all of them as needed.  \r\n\r\nThis allows for users throughout the organization to analyze, document, and most importantly, manipulate (read: make important changes to) data in large batches, quickly. In other words, don't scroll, click, and drag one or two files at a time when you can search, sort, and filter in large meaningful groups.  \r\n\r\n##About ACTIVAE 2.0\r\n\r\nMost organizations see the obvious need for platforms that allow complex management of multimedia assets. And there are several commercial platforms that can do that: Canto Cumulus, Artesia DAM, Fuzion Media Asset Management, Nuexeo DAM, and others.  \r\nHowever, the number of simple and scalable platforms based on open source software was sorely lacking for a long time. \r\n\r\nThis fork, ACTIVAE 2.0, is now being actively developed exclusively in English, and with a massive UI overhaul.  \r\n\r\nWhy the renaming/rebranding? Seriously, why not? This project was close to biting the dust. The least we can do is give it a little bit of a face-lift.  \r\n\r\n##Distinguishing features:  \r\n\r\n* **Scalability:** ACTIVAE 2.0 consists of four modules: transcoding, data access, web frontend, and an API exported via XML/RPC. Each one of them allows load balancing and high availability, so the scalability possibilities are broad:\r\n1. It can all run on one machine or additional machines can be arranged as required.\r\n1. If the use of the platform requires more storage, you can easily hot-plug it.\r\n1. If you do a lot of transcoding of multimedia formats, machines can be dedicated specifically for these jobs and even more can be added as you see the need.\r\n* **Load balancing:** is provided by the internal engine of the platform, the Cherokee web server [5]. Access to the application can be configured in this way to provide service in those cases where visitors to the platform are abundant.\r\n* **Transcoding:** ACTIVAE 2.0 allows advanced format transcoding in the platform itself- including a roadmap for popular film/video production formats, such as DNxHD & CineForm. If a production format video is added (like DNxHD, CineForm, or ProRes), it can be rendered quickly and quietly into an H.264 MP4 or WebM video for publishing on the internet. You can even convert a video to an MP3; ACTIVAE 2.0 will automatically strip the video layer and extract the audio. It supports transcoding between 200 different formats/containers, and most importantly, the transcoding is done asynchronously - decoupled and detached (in the background) while you can continue working with ACTIVAE 2.0. It is a non-blocking process... think about all the media production time you'll get back when your workstation stops holding you back during render times!\r\n* **100% AJAX GUI:** provided by the CTK library [ _Cherokee Tool Kit_ ](http://svn.cherokee-project.com/browser/CTK), a jQuery wrapper written in Python that allows the development of advanced, light and professional user interfaces.\r\n* **Pythonicness:** The platform is fully developed in Python 2.5, familiar to many readers: the API that is exported via XML/RPC, the AJAX user interface, the control and business logic, the database access, etc.\r\n* **It is open source:** ACTIVAE 2.0 is licensed under the New BSD License terms. This allows modification, use, distribution, sale, or relicensing, which is an advantage to any individual, company, or organization that wishes to use their properties for personal use or to provide services to third parties, expanding its portfolio of products and services and ultimately expanding their business opportunities.\r\n* **It is maintained _by_ media production professionals _for_ media production professionals:** As new codecs and media formats become available, you can bet that the open source implementations will be included in ACTIVAE 2.0!\r\n\r\nACTIVAE 2.0 is based on stable and very capable open source components: Xapian, Cherokee, Python, ImageMagick, FFMpeg, etc. Here are the modules used by ACTIVAE 2.0, how they are interconnected, and how each is used:\r\n![ACTIVAE 2.0 architecture](https://s9.postimg.io/4zisi11ov/activae_20_arch.png)\r\nCool, right?!\r\n\r\n##How to help\r\nThe active fork of the project is currently hosted [on GitHub.](https://github.com/54V4NT/ACTIVAE-2.0)\r\n\r\nAll necessary information for participation can be found in the [project Wiki](https://github.com/54V4NT/ACTIVAE-2.0/wiki). The _internal_ documentation of the source code as well as the comments for each commit are completely written in English. The user documentation and UI are currently available only in Spanish, but I am writing the Wiki in English and translating the previous documentation at a steady pace.\r\n\r\n###Cheers. -_54V4NT_ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###REVIEWS\r\n[Open Source Digital Asset Management 2014 roundup](http://www.opensourcedigitalassetmanagement.org/reviews/available-open-source-dam/#pwd)\r\n\r\n>Activae uses the Cherokee Web Server and includes an advanced API so is well suited for integration (but XML/RPC rather than the more conventional REST or CMIS gateways).  It includes a separate transcoding server detached from the web application which permits it to scale quite easily.  This is more common in enterprise DAM systems but less so in open source products...\r\n\r\n###Related tools and reference\r\n[Python](https://www.python.org/)  \r\n[FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)  \r\n[ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org)  \r\n[Cherokee Project](https://github.com/cherokee)  \r\n[CTK - _Cherokee Tool Kit_](https://github.com/cherokee/CTK)\r\n\r\n###Acknowledgements: \r\nSome really great thinkers were previously involved in development, and we want to acknowledge their effor.  \r\nSince this project is a 'rescue', these contributors are now nameless except for a few silly comments hidden deep within the various modules of ACTIVAE 2.0, and dead links to old companies, which we have listed in the footer- even though they lead to dark places, from which neither man nor woman may ever escape...  \r\n[Octality](http://www.octality.com)   \r\n[Atos Origin](http://www.es.atosorigin.com/es-es/)  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Activae's original development sponsor: CENATIC\r\n\r\nCENATIC is the Spanish National Competence Center for the Application of Open source Technologies. It is a public foundation, promoted by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce of the Spanish Government (through the Secretary of State for Telecommunications and Information Society and the public entity red.es) and the Extremadura Regional Government. Members of the Board are also the Regional Governments of Andalusia, Asturias, Aragon, Cantabria, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Basque Country, as well as the Atos Origin, Telefonica and GPEX companies.\r\n\r\nCENATIC's mission is to promote knowledge and use of open source software in all areas of society, with special attention to government, businesses, the ICT sector - providers or users of open source technologies - and development communities. In addition, the established Spanish regulatory framework corresponds to CENATIC general advice on legal issues, technology, and methodology most appropriate for the release of software and knowledge.  \r\nhttp://www.cenatic.es  \r\nhttp://activae.cenatic.es  ",
